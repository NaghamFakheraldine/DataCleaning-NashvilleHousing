# SQL Data Cleaning Project: Nashville Housing Data

This project of SQL queries demonstrates data cleaning operations on the NashvilleHousing table. The cleaning includes standardizing date formats, populating missing property addresses, breaking down addresses into individual columns, parsing owner addresses, converting 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No,' removing duplicates, and deleting unused columns. The queries aim to enhance data quality and prepare the dataset for further analysis or reporting.
